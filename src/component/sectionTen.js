            trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in every
            <br />
            great human achievement. and consistently, its importance has
            <br /> been overlooked. not just by individuals, but by entire
            societies. we
            <br />
            felt it was time someone gave it the spotlight it deserves.
            <br />
            especially for the ones who live by this virtue: the trustworthy.
            <br />
            <br />
            so we thought of creating a system that rewards its members for
            <br /> doing good and being trustworthy. this way, trust as a virtue
            <br /> becomes something to aspire to, just the way it should be.
            then we
            <br /> went one step ahead: we built it. we know we are on the right
            <br /> track because here you are.
            <br />
            <br /> if you make it to CRED, congratulations and welcome. we have
            a<br /> lot of things planned for you.
